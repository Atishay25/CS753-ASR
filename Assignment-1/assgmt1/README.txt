- We commented out the Q1 training part from Q2A and Q2B notebooks
- Similarly, commented out the Q2A training part from Q2B notebook and Q2B training part from Q2A notebook
- We ran assgmt1-Q4.ipynb locally, so commented out the !git clone etc commands of colab in the first cell. Please uncomment them if you want to run again on colab
- We created dummy trans.txt files for each batch in blindtest.tgz so that we can utilize the given pipeline for test_data
